# Folder Structure

The project follows the **atomic design pattern** for components and is organized as follows:

- `/components` â€“ All React UI components organized using Atomic Design.
  - `/atoms` - SBasic, indivisible UI elements (e.g., buttons, inputs, icons).
  - `/molecules` - Combinations of atoms that work together (e.g., form inputs with labels, tags with icons).
  - `/organisms` - Complex components made from molecules (e.g., navigation bars, comment sections).
  - `/templates` - Layouts composed of multiple organisms arranged in a page-like structure (e.g., HomeLayout).
- `/pages` - Next.js pages; each file here maps to a route in the application.
- `/public` - Static assets (images, fonts, icons, favicons) accessible at runtime.
- `/styles` - Global styles, variables, or utility CSS (e.g., Tailwind config overrides).
- `/config` - Configuration files (e.g., environment setup, API routes, database config).
- `/constant` - Centralized static constants (e.g., enums, option arrays, status codes, Types).
- `/contexts` - React context providers for managing global state (e.g., AuthContext, UserContext).
- `/lib` - Helper libraries or third-party integrations(e.g., auth logics)
- `/utils` - Generic utility/helper functions (e.g., timeago, formatCount).

This structure promotes reusability and maintainability by organizing components into atomic units.

## Environment Variables

Ensure the following variables are set in your `.env.local` file:

- **NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL:** Base URL for API endpoints.
